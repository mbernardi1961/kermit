# Setting up various versions of kermit
I recently (February 2024) rediscoverd the [Kermit Project](https://kermitproject.org), after being a serious user in th 1980'-90's.

Initially I wanted to be able to use kermit on my recently purchased AgonLight2. The CP/M version was included with the version of CP/M made available with the AgonLight2. But is was unable to configure the serial port used.
The new ZINC (Zinc is not CP/M) wrapper does appear to allow this to be configured.But I havent managed to get it working yet.

I also got my BBC Master working again
